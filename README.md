Azure Sentinel: Mapping Visualization of Live Cyber Attacks

Project Overview:
This project encompasses setting up Azure Sentinel, a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution, end-to-end. It involves connecting Azure Sentinel to a live virtual machine functioning as a honeypot to monitor and analyze global RDP brute force attacks. Additionally, a custom PowerShell script enhances the analysis by retrieving attackers' geolocation data and presenting it visually on the Azure Sentinel Map.
